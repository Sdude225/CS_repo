The programming language used is C#, .NET framework for easy creation of application forms and dialogs.

Upon inspection of .audit file, we observed that they structure is similar to .xml files. 

The logic of the program is to modify .audit so they could be parsed as xml.

Afterwards, we simply display the xml as a tree view.

In the end we can choose how the new file will be named, and it is saved in AppData/Local/SBT folder.

Video demonstration of inplemented features: https://youtu.be/rJhRBEcN6Vw

Main implementation code can be found in Form1.cs
